\chapter{Thurston's earthquake theorem}

\begin{definition}
    A geodesic lamination $\lambda$ of $\H^2$ is a collection of disjoint geodesic that foliate a closed subset $X$ of $\H^2$. The set $X$ is called the \textit{support} of $\lambda.$ The geodesic in $\lambda$ are called \textit{leaves} (as in classic foliation terminology). The connected components of $\H^2\;\setminus\;X$ are called \textit{gaps}. The \textit{strata} of $\lambda$ are the leaves and the gaps.
\end{definition}

Consider $\gamma$ an isometry of $\H^2$, the \textit{axis} of the isometry is the geodesic $\ell$ of $\H^2$ connecting the two fixed points of $\gamma$ in $\partial\H^2$. As a consequence we have that the geodesic is preserved by the isometry, when restricted to such a curve $\gamma_\ell:\ell\to\ell$ acts as a translation with respect to any constant speed parametrization of $\ell$.\\
Given $A,B$ subsets of $\H^2,$ we say that a geodesic $\ell$ \textit{weakly separated} $A$ and $B$ if $A$ and $B$ are contained in the closure of different connected components of $\H^2\;\setminus\;\ell.$ 

\begin{definition}
    A \textit{left earthquake} of $\H^2$ is a bijective map $E:\H^2\to\H^2$ such that there exists a geodesic lamination $\lambda$ for which the restriction $E_S$ to any stratum $S$ of $\lambda$ is equal to the restriction of an isometry of $\H^2,$ and for any two strata $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ of $\lambda$ the comparison isometry 
    
    \[
        \text{Comp}(S,S^{\prime})\coloneqq (E_S)^{-1}\circ E_S^{\prime}
    \]

    is the restriction of an isometry of $\H^2$ such that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\gamma$ is different from the identity, unless possibly where one of the two strata $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ is contained in the closure of the other;
        \item when it's note the identity, $\gamma$ is a hyperbolic transformation whose axis $\ell$ weakly separetes $S$ and $S^{\prime};$
        \item moreover, $\gamma$ translates to the left, seen from $S$ to $S^{\prime}$. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Let's explain more carefully what we mean with the last condition. Suppose $f:[0,1]\to\H^2$ is a smooth path such that $f(0)\in S,\;f(1)\in S^{\prime}$ and the image of $f$ intersects $\ell$ transversally and exactly at one point $z_0=f(t_0)\in\ell.$ Let $v=f^{\prime}(t_0)\in T_{z_0}\H^2$ be the tangent vector at the intersection point. Let $w\in T_{z_0}\H^2$ be a vector tangent to the geodesic $\ell$ pointing towards $\gamma(z_0).$ Then we say that $\gamma$ translates to the left seen from $S$ to $S^{\prime} $ if $v,w$ is a positive basis of $T_{z_0}\H^2$, for the standard orientation of $\H_2.$\\
We observe that such a condition is independent of the order we order in which we choose $S$ and $S^{\prime},$  if $\text{Comp}(S,S^{\prime})$ translates to the left seen from $S$ to $S^{\prime},$ then $\text{Comp}(S^{\prime} ,S)$ translates to the left seen from $S^{\prime} $ to $S.$ 

%ok ma cosa vuol dire davvero questa cosa?

\begin{observation} The earthquake $E$ is not required to be (and in fact in some case won't be) continuous. For instance this happens when the lamination $\lambda$ is finite, meaning that $\lambda$ is a collection of a finite number of geodesics. 
\end{observation}

Let's consider a first basic example: 

\textit{Esempio}\todo{creare un ambiente ah-hoc} The map 
\[
    E:\H^2\to\H^2
\]

defined by:
\[
  E(z)= \begin{cases}
    z & \text{if Re(z)}<0 \\
    az & \text{if Re(z)}=0 \\
    bz & \text{if Re(z)}>0 \\    
\end{cases}
\]

is a left earthquake if $1<a<b,$ and a right earthquake if $0<b<a<1$. The lamination $\lambda$ that satisfies the definition is composed of a unique geodesic, namely the geodesic $\ell$ corresponding to the imaginary axis. \\
Such a map is clearly not continuous along $\ell$.
Thurston proved (\textcolor{red}{dove?}) that any earthquake map extends continuously to an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of $\partial\H^2$ meaning that there exist a (unique) orientation-preserving homeomorphism $f:\partial\H^2\to\partial\H^2$ such that the map: 
\[
    \begin{cases}
        E(z), &\text{ if z }\in \H^2\\
        f(z), &\text{ if z}\in \partial\H^2  ;\\
        
    \end{cases}
\]
is continuous in any point $\partial(\H^2.)$\\
Then Thurston proved the following theorem, that he called \textit{"geology is transitive}:

\begin{theorem}
    Given any orientation-preserving homeomorphism $f:\partial\H^2\to\partial\H^2,$ there exists a left earthquake map of $\H^2,$ and a right earthquake map, that extends continuously to $f$ on $\partial\H^2.$
\end{theorem}

\section{Affine space and Convexity Notions}
The initial step in our proof is to consider the graph of an orientation-preserving homeomorphism $f:\R\text{P}^1\to\R\text{P}^1$ as a subset of $\partial\A^{2,1}$, and taking its convex hull. However, the convex hull of a set in projective space can be defined in affine chart, but $\overline{\A^{2,1}}$ is not contained in any affine chart. The following lemma has the purpose to show that the convex hull of the graph of $f$ is well-defined: 
\begin{lemma}\label{bdconvex}
    Let $f:\R\text{P}^1\to\R\text{P}^1$ be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism. Then: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There exists a spacelike plane $\text{P}_\gamma$ in $\A^{2,1}$ such that $\partial\A^{2,1}\cap\text{graph}(f)=\emptyset.$
        \item Given any point $(x_0,y_0)\notin\text{graph}(f)$, there exists a spacelike plane $\text{P}_\gamma$ such that $\partial\text{P}_\gamma=\emptyset$ and $(x_0,y_0)\in\partial\text{P}_\gamma.$ 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We recall that $\PSL$ acts transitively on pairs of distinct points of $\R\text{P}^1\simeq\R\cup\{\infty\}$ (actually more is true, as it acts simply transitively on \textit{positively oriented triples}). Hence we may assume, up to the action of the isometry group of $\A^{2,1}$ by post-composition on $f$ (remark something that I have to cite), that $f(0)=0$ and $f(\infty)=\infty.$ The $f$ induces a monotone increasing homeomorphism from $R\to\R$. Since $f(0)=0,$ the map $f$ preserves the two intervals: $(-\infty,0)$ and $(0,\infty).$ Let now $\gamma=\mathcal{R}_i$ be the order-two elliptic isometry fixing $i$. Clearly $\gamma$ is an involution that maps $0\to\infty,$ \todo{show this}, and switches the two intervals $(-\infty,0)$ and $(0,\infty)$. Hence $f(x)\neq\gamma(x)$ for all $x\in\R\cup\{\infty\}$, that is $\text{graph}(f)\cap\text{graph}(\gamma)=\emptyset.$ Now by lemma \textcolor{red}{cite} and the fact that $\gamma$ is an involution, $\text{graph}(f)\cap\partial\text{P}_\gamma=\emptyset.$
        \item In proving this point we will use the aforementioned $\PSL$-transitivy on triples, and we will apply both pre and post-composition of an element of $\PSL$. We observe that if $(x_0,y_0)\notin\text{graph}(f)$, then we can find points $x,x^{\prime}$ such that $f$ maps the unoriented arc of $\R\text{P}^1$ connecting $x,x^{\prime}$ containing $x_0$ to the unoriented arc connecting $f(x),f(x^{\prime})$ \textit{not} containing $f(y_0),$ the proof is just figure \textcolor{red}{inserire la figura}. Now, since $f$ preserve the orientation of $\R\text{P}^1,$ up to switching $x,x^{\prime}$, we have that $(x, x_0, x^{\prime})$ is a positive triple in $\S$, while $(f(x),y_0,f(x^{\prime}))$ is a negative triple. \\
        Following the observation, and using simply transitivity on oriented triples, we can assume $(x,x_0,x^{\prime})=(0,1,\infty)$ and $(f(x),y_0,f(x^{\prime}))=(0,-1,\infty).$ At this point choosing $\gamma=\mathcal{R}_i$ as in the first point of the proof satisfies the condition in the second item as well, since $\gamma(1)=-1$.  
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

Now, given a spacelike plane $\text{P}_\gamma$ in $\A^{2,1}$, let $\mathcal{P}_\gamma$ be the unique projective subspaces in $\text{P}\mathcal{M}(2,\R)$ that contains $\text{P}_\gamma$, which is identified by the equation \refeq{spacelike} (where now $[A]=\gamma$). Let us denote by $\mathcal{A}_\gamma$ the complement of $\mathcal{P}_\gamma$, which we will call a (\textit{spacelike}) \textit{affine chart}. In this setting the first item of the lemma \ref{bdconvex} can be riformulated as: 
\begin{corollary}
    Let $f:\S\to\S$ be an oriented-preserving homeomorphism. There exists a spacelike affine chart $\mathcal{A}_\gamma$ containing $\text{graph}(f)$.
\end{corollary} 

Resolved any matter with the good definition of convex hull of $\text{graph}(f)$ we want to understand the matter with an example: \\
\textit{Example:} Given $\sigma \in \PSL,$ the convex hull of $\text{graph}(\sigma)$ is the closure of the totally geodesic spacelike plane $\text{P}_{\sigma^{-1}}$ in $\A^{2,1}.$ Actually, because of lemma \textcolor{red}{u know the drill}, the boundary at inifinity of $P_{\sigma^{-1}}$ equals $\text{graph}(\sigma),$ and moreover $\text{P}_{\sigma^{-1}}$ is convex, since spacelike geodesics of $\A^{2,1}$ (which are the intersection of two transverse spacelike planes) are lines in an affine chart, and any two points of $\partial\H^2$ are connected by a geodesic. Hence $\text{P}_{\sigma^{-1}}$ is clearly the smallest convex set containing $\text{graph}(\sigma).$\\
This is the only case where $\text{graph}(\sigma)$ is contained in a plane, and therefore it's convex hull as empty interior. If $f$ is not the restriction to $\S$ of an element of $\PSL$, then the convex hull of $\text{graph}(f)$ is a convex body in the affine chart $\mathcal{A}_\gamma.$

To continue in our exploration of convexity in $\A^{2,1}$ we will need one last technical Lemma similar in spirit to \ref{bdconvex}: 
\begin{lemma}
    Let $f:\S\to\S$ be and orientation-preserving homeomorphism and let $\text{P}_\gamma$ in $\A^{2,1}$ be a spacelike plane such that $\partial\text{P}_\gamma\cap\text{graph}(f)=\emptyset.$ Given any two distinct points $(x,f(x)), (x^{\prime} ,f(x^{\prime} ))$ in $\text{graph}(f)$, there exists a spacelike plane, disjoint from P$_\gamma$, containing them in its boundary at infinity. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}
    Acting via $\PSL\times\PSL$ we can assume that $\gamma=\text{Id}$. The hypothesis $\partial\text{P}_{\text{Id}}\cap\text{graph(f)}=\emptyset$ can be rephrased as saying that $f$ has no fixed point. We are looking for a $\sigma\in\PSL$ such that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item P$_{\text{Id}}\cap\text{P}_\sigma=\emptyset$ 
        \item $(x,f(x)),(x^{\prime} ,f(x^{\prime}))\in\partial\text{P}_{\sigma^{-1}}=\text{graph}(\sigma).$
    \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    For the first condition to hold it is suffices that the boundary of $\text{P}_{\text{Id}},\text{P}_{\sigma^{-1}}$ do not intersect, that is to say, $\sigma(y)\neq y$ for every $y\in\S$. We are then asking for a $\sigma$ with no fixed points on $\S$, namely $\sigma$ has to be an elliptic isometry. The second condition can be restated as $\sigma(x)=f(x)$ and $\sigma(x^{\prime})=f(x^{\prime}).$\\
Now, since $f$ has no fixed points, $f(x)\neq x$ and $f(x^{\prime})\neq x^{\prime}$. There are various case to distinguish (refer to figure \textcolor{red}{inserire} for a visual aid). First we suppose for $(x,f(x),x^{\prime})$ to be a positive triple. Then either $(x,f(x^{\prime}),f(x),x^{\prime})$ or $(x,f(x),x^{\prime},f(x^{\prime}))$ are in cyclic order, because the remaining possibility, namely that $(x,f(x),f(x^{\prime}) ,x^{\prime})$ are in cyclic order, would imply that $f$ has a fix point. \todo{why so?} If $(x,f(x^{\prime}),f(x),x^{\prime})$ are in cyclic order, then the hyperbolic geodesic $\ell$ connecting $x$ to $f(x)$ and $\ell^{\prime}$ conntecting $x^{\prime} $ to $f(x^{\prime})$ must intersect, and the order two elliptic isometry $\sigma$ fixing $\ell\cap\ell^{\prime}$ maps $x\to f(x)$ and $x^{\prime} \to f(x^{\prime})$.\\
If $(x,f(x),x^{\prime},f(x^{\prime}))$ are in cyclic order, then the geodesic $\ell_1$ connecting $x$ to $x^{\prime}$ and the geodesic $\ell_2$ connecting $f(x)$ to $f(x^{\prime})$ must intersect and one can find an elliptic element $\sigma$ fixing $\ell_1\cap\ell_2$ sending $x\to f(x)$ and $x^{\prime} \to f(x^{\prime}).$\\ \todo{manca da aggiungere la fine di questo lemmetto tencnicotecnico.}
\end{proof}

\section{The fundamental example.} We want to now finally link Ads geometry, in particular pleated surfaces, with the earthquake theory. Before stating the precise results we explore what we can consider the \textit{fundamental example.} Let $S$ be a piecewise totally geodesic surfaces consisting in the union of two half-planes in $\A^{2,1}$ meeting along a spacelike geodesic as in \textcolor{red}{inserire figura}

We want to understand the left and right projection for this surface $S$. Observe that these are well-defined in the complement of spacelike geodesic which constitutes the bending locus of $S.$ The projections $\Pi_l$ and $\Pi_r$ are isometric on each (totally geodesic) connected component of the complement of such bendind geodesic in $S$ [refernece]. Let us call the two components $S_1,S_2$. Without loss of generality we can assum that $S_1$ is contained in the plane $P_{Id}$ composed of order-two elliptic elements in $\PSL$. Therefore the bending locus is a spacelike geodesic contained in $P_{Id}$, namely the set of order-two elliptic elements having a fixed point in a geodesic $\ell $ of $\H^2$.
