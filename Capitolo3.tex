\chapter{Anti-de Sitter space in dimension (2+1)}
We want now to specialize to dimension three Anti-de Sitter geometry as it will be the specific model geometry of the manifolds of our next interest. 
\section{The {PSL}$(2,\R)$ model.} 

The fundamental observation is the existence of a special model in dimension three which endows Anti-de Sitter space with a Lie group structure. To construct such a model we observe that $q=-$det is a quadratic form with signature (2,2) over the real vector space $\mathcal{M}(2,\R)$. The associated bilinear form is expressed by the formula:
\begin{equation}\label{quadratic}
    \langle A,B\rangle=-\frac{1}{2}\text{tr}(A\cdot\text{adj}(B))
\end{equation}
for $A,B\in\mathcal{M}(2,\R)$, where adj denotes the adjugate matrix, namely: 
\[
    \text{adj}(\begin{bmatrix}
        a & b \\
        c & d
    \end{bmatrix}) = \begin{bmatrix}
        d & -b \\
        -c & a
    \end{bmatrix}
\]

hence there is an identification between $(\mathcal{M}(2,\R),q)$ and $(\R^{2,2}, q_{2,2}),$ unique up to composition by elements in $O(2,2)$. Under this isomorphism $\H^{2,1}$ is identified with the Lie group $\text{SL}(2,\R).$\\
Let us observe that $\text{SL}(2,\R)\times \text{SL}(2,\R)$ acts linearly on $\mathcal{M}(2,\R)$ by left and right multiplication:
$$(A,B)\cdot X=AXB^{-1}.$$

As a direct consequence of the Binet formula, the action preserves the quadratic form $q=$-det and thus induces a representation: 

\[ \rho:\text{SL}(2,\R)\times \text{SL}(2,\R)\to O(\mathcal{M}(2,\R),q). \]

Since the center of $\text{SL}(2,\R)$ is $\{\pm \text{Id}\},$ the kernel of $\rho$ is $K=\{(\text{Id},\text{Id}),(-\text{Id},-\text{Id})\},$ and by a dimensional argument (and connectedness of $\text{SL}(2,\R)$) it turns out that the image of the representation is the connected component of the identity: 
\[
    \text{Isom}_0(\H^{2,1})=\text{SO}_0(\mathcal{M}(2,\R),q)\simeq (\text{SL}(2,\R)\times \text{SL}(2,\R))/K
\]
    
Using this model, one has natural identification between $\A^{n,1}$ and the Lie group $\PSL$, in such a way that: 
\begin{equation}\label{isomiso}
    \text{Isom}_0(\A^{n,1})\simeq \PSL\times\PSL
\end{equation}
    
acting by left and right multiplication on $\PSL$.\\ We are mostly interested in orientation-preserving and time-preserving notions that do not depend on a chosen orientation, nevertheless we will fix here an orientation and a time-orientation of $\A^{2,1}\simeq\PSL.$ As we are dealing with a Lie group it is sufficient to define on orientation of the Lie algebra, namely the tangent at the identity Id. We declare as (positive) oriented basis of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\R):$ 
\begin{equation}{tangent}
V=\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}\;\;
W=\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
\;\;
U=\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The first two vectors $V,W$ are spacelike, while $U$ is timelike. $U$ is the tangent vector to the one-parameter group of elliptic isometries of $\H^2$ fixing $i\in\H^2$, parametrized by the angle of clockwise rotation; $V,W$ are vectors tangent to the one-parameter groups of loxodromic isometries fixing the geodesic with endpoints $(-1,1)$ and $(0,\infty)$ respectively. Time-orientation can also be inherited by the Lie algebra, we declare that $U$ is future-pointing timelike vector. \\

The stabilizer of the identity in Isom$_0(\A^{n,1})$ is the diagonal subgroup $\Delta<\PSL\times\PSL$. Under the obvious identification of $\PSL$ and $\Delta,$ the action of the identity stabilizer on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\R)=T_{\text{Id}}\PSL$ is the adjoint action of $\PSL$. A direct consequence of this construction is the bi-invariance of the quadratic form $q$. Indeed, denoting by $q_{\text{Id}}$ the restriction of $q$ to $T_{\text{Id}}\text{SL}(2,\R)$, a direct computation shows that $q_\text{Id}$ equals $(1/8)\kappa$ where $\kappa(X,Y)=4tr(XY)$ is the Killing form of $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \R)$.

\begin{observation}\label{311}
    The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\R)$ equipped with the quadratic form $q_{\text{Id}}$ is then a copy of the 3-dimensional Minkowski space, hence the adjoint action yields a representation 
    \[
        \PSL\to O(\mathfrak{sl}(2,\R),q_{\text{Id}})
    \]

which in turn induces the well-known isomorphism: 
\[
    \text{SO}_0(2,1)\simeq\text{SO}_0(\mathfrak{sl}(2,\R), q_\text{Id})\simeq \PSL,
\] which is nothing but the restriction of the isomorphism of Equation \ref{isomiso} to the stabilizer of the identity in the left-hand side $\text{Isom}(\A^{2,1}),$ and to the diagonal subgroup $\Delta$ in the right-hand side $\PSL\times\PSL.$
\end{observation}

\section{The boundary of $\PSL$)} 
From the aforementioned identification we obtain a new one between $\partial\A^{2,1}$ with the boundary of $\PSL$, namely $\text{P}(\mathcal{M}(2,\R))$, the projectivization of the cone of rank 1 matrices. Therefore from now on we shall consider 
\[
    \partial\A^{2,1}=\{[X]\in\text{P}(\mathcal{M}(2,\R))|\;\text{rank}(X)=1\}
\]
We endow $\overline{\A^{2,1}}=\A^{2,1}\cup\partial\A^{2,1}$ with the topology induced by seeing both as subsets of the real projective space $\text{P}(\mathcal{M}(2,\R)).$ We want to observe that we have the following homeomorphism: 
\begin{align*}\label{delta}
    \delta:\partial\A^{2,1}&\rightarrow\R\text{P}^1\times\R\text{P}^1\\
    [X]&\mapsto (\text{Im}(X),\text{Ker}(X))
\end{align*}


where we are considering $\R\text{P}^1$ as the space of one-dimensional subspaces of $\R^2$. Since we have that $\text{Im}(AXB^{-1})=A\cdot\text{Im}(X)$ and $\text{Ker} (AXB^{-1})=B\cdot\text{Ker}(X),$ the map $\delta$ is equivariant with respect to the action of $\PSL\times\PSL,$ acting on $\partial\A^{2,1}$ as the natural extension of the group of isometries of $\A^{2,1}$ and on $\R\text{P}^1\times\R\text{P}^1$ by the obvious product action.\\
In this setting our choice of a time-orientation \textit{can be modified} according to the following Lemma:
\begin{lemma}\label{invertime}
    The inversion map $\iota[X]=[X]^{-1}$ is a time-reversing isometry of $\A^{2,1}$ which induces the homeomorphism $(x,y)\to(y,x)$ on the boundary $\partial\A^{2,1}.$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    It follows from definition that $\iota$ is equivariant with respect to the isomorphism of $\PSL\times\PSL$ which switches left and right factors. As $\text{d}_\text{Id}\iota=-\text{Id}$ is a linear isometry, $\iota$ is an isometry, the differential being minus the identity also shows time-reversal. \\
    The second part of the statement can be checked via the following. For a $2\times2$ matrix the Cayley-Hamilton theorem implies the equality $(\det X)X^{-1}=(\text{tr}X)(\text{Id}-X),$ so that projectively we have $[X^{-1}]=[\text{tr}X\text{Id}-X].$ Hence $\iota$ extends to the transformation $[X]\to[\text{tr}X\text{Id}-X]$ on $\partial\A^{2,1}.$ Now is $X$ is a rank $1$ matrix, it is traceless if and only if $X^2=0$, hence $\text{Ker}(X)=\text{Im}(X).$ If $\text{tr}(X)\neq 0$, then $X$ is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $0$ and $\text{tr}(X)$. Moreover $\text{Ker}(X)$ and $\text{Im}(X)$ are the corresponding eigenspaces. It follows then that $\text{Ker}(\text{tr}X\text{Id}-X)=\text{Im}(X)$ and $\text{Im}(\text{tr}X\text{Id}-X)=\text{Ker}X$ 
\end{proof}


Consider the hyperbolic model of the upper half-plane $\H^2.$ $\R\text{P}^1$ correspond to the boundary at infinity $\partial\H^2$ and $\PSL$ is identified to $\text{Isom}_0(\H^2$.) In this key we can consider $\partial\A^{2,1}$ as $\partial\H^2\times\partial\H^2$. We can then interpret the convergence to $\partial\A^{2,1}$ in this setting:

\begin{lemma}\label{convergenza}
    A sequence $[X_n]\in\A^{2,1}$ converges to $(x,y)\in\partial\A^{2,1}\simeq\T$ if and only if for every $p\in\H^2,$ $X_n(p)\to x$ and $X_n^{-1}(p)\to y.$ 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    $\PSL$ acts on $\H^2$ via isometries, hence if the conditions holds for some $p$ then it holds for all $p\in\H^2$. Without loss of generality we can assume $p=i$ in the upper half-plane. Assuming $X_n$ converges projectively to a rank 1 matrix $X$, one check immediately that $X(p)$ in the projective class of $x=\text{Im}(X).$ The convergence of $X_n^{-1}(p)\to y$ is just a straightforward application of Lemma \ref{invertime} and an analogous argument to the one given for $X_n(p)$.
\end{proof}

In dimension three $\partial\A^{2,1}$ is a doubly ruled quadric, which in an affine chart looks like \textcolor{red}{inserire cono}. We shall describe such rulings in a more geometric way. Given any $(x_0,y_0)\in\partial\A^{2,1}$, 
\begin{equation}\label{ruling}
        \lambda_{y_0}\coloneqq\{(x,y_0)|x\in\R\text{P}^1\}
\end{equation}

describe a projective line in $\R\text{P}^3$ which is contained in $\partial\A^{2,1}$, hence lightlike for the conformal Lorentzian structure of $\partial\A^{2,1},$ as seen in Remark \ref{222}. In fact $\lambda_{y_0}$ is the orbit of $(x_0,y_0)$ by the action of $\PSL\times\{\text{Id}\},$ or by the (now free) action of $\text{PSO}(2,\R)\times\{\text{Id}\}.$ Here $\text{PSO}(2,\R)$ corresponds to a 1-parameter elliptic subgroup in $\PSL$. In short: 
\[
    \lambda_{y_0}=\PSL\cdot(x_0,y_0)=\text{PSO}(2,\R)\cdot(x_0,y_0).
\]

We refer to $\lambda_{y_0}$ as the \textit{left ruling} through $(x_0,y_0)$, and similarly the \textit{right ruling} is 
\[
    \mu_{x_0}\coloneqq\{(x_0,y)|y\in\R\text{P}^1\}
\]

Our interest in $\partial\A^{2,1}$ is mainly justified by the following: when we will deal with earthquake theory we will often consider $\varphi:\S\to\S$ an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the circle. The associated graph $\Lambda_\varphi$ via means of the identification given by $\delta$ is a subset of $\partial\A^{2,1}$. We observe that from equivariance of $\delta$ the following holds for every $(\alpha,\beta)\in\PSL\times\PSL$: 
\begin{equation}\label{graphequivariancy}
(\alpha,\beta)\cdot\Lambda_\varphi=\Lambda_{\beta\circ\varphi\circ\alpha^{-1}}.
\end{equation}
We remark one last time that we will consider $\partial\A^{2,1}$ as always implicitly identified with $\T$ via $\delta$.

\section{Geodesic in $\PSL$.} We have already seen geodesic in the general Anti-de Sitter space, we would like to specialize here using the model of $\PSL$ and tools from general Lie Group theory. In particular we recall the following: 
\begin{lemma}\label{331}[Per più informazioni \cite{bonsanteseppi}]
    Given left-invariant vector fields $V$ and $W$ on $G$, the Levi-Civita connection of a bi-invariant metric has the expression: 
    \[
        \nabla_VW=\frac{1}{2}[V,W].
    \]
    In particular, the Lie group exponential coincides with the pseudo-Riemannian exponential map.
\end{lemma}




We would like to start by considering geodesic through the identity. The Lie algebra of $\PSL$ is isometrically identified with Minkowski space, as seen in Remark \ref{311}, where under such an isometry the stabilizer of a point (namely $\PSL$ acting by means of the adjoint action) corresponds to the group of linear isometries of Minkowski space. In short, this means that we shall distinguish geodesic by their type (timelike, spacelike, lightlike) and those will be equivalent under this action. Moreover, by Lemma \ref{331} it suffices to understand the one-parameter group for the Lie group structure of $\PSL$. We immediately get the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Timelike geodesic are, up to conjugacy, of the form: 
    \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos(t) & -\sin(t) \\
    \sin(t) & \cos(t)
     \end{bmatrix}
\]
namely, under the identification of $\PSL$ with $\text{Isom}(\H^2)$, they are elliptic one-parameter groups fixing a point in $\H^2$. In this example, the tangent vector is the matrix
\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & -1 \\
    1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}.
    \]
These are closed geodesics, parametrized by arclenght, of total length $\pi$. 
\item Spacelike geodesic are, again up to conjugacy, of the form: 
\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \cosh(t) & \sinh(t) \\
    \sinh(t) & \cosh(t) \end{bmatrix}
\]
with initial velocity: 
\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}.
\]
In the hyperbolic settings, these are loxodromic one-parameter groups, fixing two points in the boundary of $\H^2$ (in the particular case, $\pm 1$). 
\item Finally, lightlike geodesic are the parabolic one-parameter groups conjugate to: 
\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & t \\
        0 & 1 
    \end{bmatrix},
\]
whose initial vector has indeed zero length.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Timelike geodesics}
When looking for a complete description of timelike geodesics it suffices to let (the identity component of) the isometry group of $\A^{2,1}$ (namely $\PSL\times\PSL)$ act on $\PSL$ via left and right multiplication. In particular, we can describe the whole space of timelike geodesic of $\A^{2,1}$ as follows: 

\begin{proposition}\label{352}
    There is a homeomorphism between the space of (unparametrized) timelike geodesics of $\A^{2,1}$ and $\H^2\times\H^2$. The homomorphism is equivariant for the action of $\text{Isom}_{0} (\A^{2,1})\simeq \PSL\times\PSL$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    The homeomorphism is defined as follows. Given a point $(p,q)\in \H^2\times\H^2,$ we associate to it the subset: 
    \[
        L_{p,q}=\{X\in\PSL\;|\;X\cdot q=p\}
    \]
    By the previous discussion, geodesic through the identity are precisely of the form $L_{p,p}$ for some $p\in\H^2.$ The map $(p,q)\mapsto L_{p,q}$ is equivariant for the natural actions of $\PSL\times \PSL$, namely $(A,B)\cdot L_{p,q}=L_{A\cdot p,B\cdot q},$ which also implies that $L_{p,q}$ is an unparameterized geodesic and that all the unparameterized geodesic are of this form, namely the map we defined is surjective. It remains to show injectivity; if $L_{p,q}=L_{p^{\prime} ,q^{\prime} }$ for $(p,q)\neq(p^{\prime},q^{\prime} )$ then in particular there exists an isometry of $\H^2$ sending $p$ to $q$ and $p^{\prime} $ to $q^{\prime}$, but such an isometry is necessarily unique since the identity is the only isometry of $\H^2$ fixing two different points. This gives rise to a contradiction and concludes.  
\end{proof}

\subsection{Spacelike geodesics}
Let us consider $\ell$ an oriented geodesic of the hyperbolic plane $\H^2$. From what we have already discussed the one-parameter group of hyperbolic transformation fixing $\ell$ as an \textit{oriented} geodesic constitutes a spacelike geodesic through the origin. By an argument analogous to the one given in Proposition \ref{352}, relying on the equivariance of the construction by the actions of $\PSL\times\PSL$, one proves that every spacelike geodesic is of the form: 
\[
    L_{\ell,\jmath}=\{X\in\PSL\;|\;X\cdot\jmath=\ell\;\text{as oriented geodesics}\},
\]
where $\ell$ and $\jmath$ denote oriented geodesic of $\H^2$. We want to emphasize that every (unparameterized, unoriented) spacelike geodesic can be expressed in the above form in two ways, as we could change the orientation of both $\ell$ and $\jmath$. Rephrasing we can state: 
\begin{proposition}\label{353}
    There is a homeomorphism between the space of (unparametrized) oriented spacelike geodesics of $\A^{2,1}$ and the product of two copies of $\partial\H^2\times\partial\H^2\setminus\Delta,$ the space of oriented geodesics of $\H^2$. The homeomorphism is equivariant for the action of $\text{Isom}_0(\A^{2,1})\simeq\PSL\times\PSL$.
\end{proposition}

However we will not be really interested in oriented geodesics, hence we will have identification $L_{\ell,\jmath}=L_{\ell^{\prime},\jmath}$ where with $\ell^{\prime} $ with denote $\ell$ endowed with the opposite orientation.\todo{diverso da survey, controllare, qua qualcosa non torna, vedi anche l'esempio successivo}\\
Given a spacelike geodesic, there is a natural notion of \textit{dual} spacelike geodesic, which we define using the projectivity duality between points and planes discussed in \ref{polarsec}: 
\begin{definition}
    Given a spacelike geodesic $L_{\ell,\jmath}$ in $\A^{2,1}$, the \textit{dual spacelike geodesic} is the intersection of all the spacelike planes dual to point of $L_{\ell,\jmath}.$  
\end{definition}

The construction of the dual geodesic is involutive, let's see it with an explicit example. Consider the geodesic $L_{\ell,\ell}$ through the origin, which consists of the one-parameter loxodromic group of $\PSL$ translating along $\ell$, it can be checked that the dual geodesic consists of all elliptic order-two elements (hence contained in $P_{\text{Id}}$, as we could expect from the definition) whose fixed point lies in $\ell$. In other words, the dual spacelike geodesic of $L_{\ell,\ell}$ is $L_{\ell,\ell^{\prime}}.$\\
We can explicitely describe the points at infinity in $\partial\A^{2,1}$ of these geodesic. Using Lemma \ref{convergenza}, if $x$ and $y$ are the endpoints at infinity of $\ell$ in $\partial\H^2,$ then any sequence diverging towards an end of $L_{\ell,\ell^{\prime}}\subset \PSL$ maps an interior point towards $x$, and the sequence of inverses towards $y$ (up to switching the two points). In other words, under the identification given by $\delta$ between $\partial\A^{2,1}\simeq\T$, the endpoints of $L_{\ell,\ell}$ are $(x,y)$ and $(y,x)$. A similar argument applied to the geodesic $L_{\ell,\ell^{\prime} },$ which consists of order-two elliptic isometries with fixed point in $\ell$ shows that its endpoints are $(x,x)$ and $(y,y).$\\
Recall the description of the left and right rulings of $\partial\A^{2,1}$ given in \refeq{ruling}, we can conclude that the endpoints of a spacelike geodesic and it's dual are mutually connected by lightlike segments in $\partial\A^{2,1}$. \textcolor{red}{ora lui dice di guardare due figure.}\\
The naturality of the above construction with respect of the action of $\PSL\times\PSL$ let us state: 
\begin{proposition}
    Given a spacelike geodesic $L_{\ell,\jmath}$ of $\A^{2,1}$, its endpoints in $\partial \A^{2.1}$ are $(x_1,y_2)$ and $(y_1,x_2)$, where $x_1$ and $y_1$ are the final and initial endpoints of $\ell$ in $\partial\H^2$, and $x_2$ and $y_2$ are the final and initial endpoints of $\jmath$. The dual geodesic is $L_{\ell,\jmath}$ and has endpoints $(x_1,x_2)$ and $y_1,y_2.$
\end{proposition}


\section{Spacelike planes}
Now we want to study totally geodesic spacelike planes in $\A^{2,1}.$ They are all obtained as the intersection of $\A^{2,1}$ with a projective subspace in the projective space $\text{P}\mathcal{M}(2,\R).$ Hence they are all of the the following form: 
\begin{equation}\label{geoplanes}
    P_{[A]}=\{[X]\in\PSL\;|\;\langle X,A\rangle=0\}
\end{equation}
for some non-zero matrix $A$. The notation is justified by the observation that the plane defined by $P_A$ depends only on the projective class of $A$. The totally geodesic plane is spacelike if and only if $q(A)=-\det A$ is negative. We will call such a plane \textit{dual plane} of $A$, in particular the dual plane $P_\gamma$  of an element $\gamma\in\PSL$ is a spacelike totally geodesic plane. \\
\begin{example}\label{spacelikeisometry}
Before the general treatment we want to focus on a concrete example. Consider $\gamma=\text{Id}\in\PSL.$ Now because of Equation \refeq{quadratic}, $P_{\text{Id}}$ is the subset of $\PSL$ consisting of projective class of unit matrices $X$ with $\text{tr}(X)=0$. By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, $X^2=-\text{Id},$ hence the elements of $P_{\text{Id}}$ are order-two isometries of $\H^2,$ that is, elliptic elements with rotation angle $\pi$.  We can also observe that $P_{\text{Id}}$ is invariant under the actions of $\PSL$ by conjugation, which corresponds to the diagonal in the isometry group $\PSL\times\PSL$ of $\A^{2,1}$. Using Lemma \ref{convergenza}, we can see that the boundary of $P_\gamma$ in $\partial\A^{2,1}\simeq \R\text{P}^1\times\R\text{P}^1$ is the diagonal; more precisely: 
\begin{equation}\label{graphino}
    \partial P_\gamma=\text{graph(Id)}\subset \T.
\end{equation}

Now consider a point $z\in\H^2$, and let us denote by $\mathcal{R}_z$ the order-two elliptic isometry with fixed point $z$. We claim that the map 
\[
    \iota:\H^2\to P_{\text{Id}},\;\;\;\ \iota(z)=\mathcal{R}_z
\]

is an isometry with respect to the hyperbolic metric of $\H^2$ and the induced metric on $P_{\text{Id}}.$ First, the inverse of $\iota$ is simply the fixed-point map $\text{Fix}:P_{\text{Id}}\to\H^2$ sending an elliptic isometry to its fixed point, which also shows that $\iota$ is equivariant with respect to the action of $\PSL$ on $\H^2$ by homographies and on $P_\text{Id}$ by conjugation, since $\text{Fix}(\alpha\gamma\alpha^{-1})=\alpha\text{Fix}(\gamma).$ That is, the following holds: 
\begin{equation}
    \iota(\alpha\cdot p)=\alpha\circ\iota(p)\circ\alpha^{-1}.
\end{equation} 
A direct consequence is that $\iota$ is isometric, since the pull-back of the metric of $P_\text{Id}$ is necessarily $\PSL$-invariant and has constant curvature -1, hence it coincides with the standard hyperbolic metric on the upper half-plane.
\end{example}
This simple example is actually the key case to understand general spacelike totally geodesic planes as every spacelike totally geodesic plane is of the form $P_\gamma$ for some $\gamma\in\PSL.$ To see this, observe that the action of the isometry group of $\A^{2,1}$ on spacelike totally geodetic planes is transitive, and that $P_\gamma=(\gamma,\text{Id})\cdot P_{\text{Id}}$ as the isometry $(\gamma,\text{Id})$ maps $\text{Id}\to\gamma$, and therefore the dual plane of $\text{Id}$ to the dual plane of $\gamma.$ In view of the observations given in \refeq{graphequivariancy} and \refeq{graphino}, we can conclude the following: 
\begin{lemma}\label{32}
    Every spacelike totally geodesic plane of $\A^{2,1}$ is of the form $P_\gamma$ for some orientation-preserving isometry $\gamma\in\PSL,$ and 
    \[
        \partial P_\gamma=\text{graph}(\gamma^{-1})\subset\T.
    \]
\end{lemma}
\section{Timelike planes}
Let's consider now a matrix $A\in\mathcal{M}(2,\R)$ such that $\det(A)=-1.$ The corresponding plane $P_A$ defined by equation \refeq{geoplanes} is a timelike totally geodesic plane. Associated with $[A]$ is an orientation-reversing isometry $\eta$ of $\H^2.$ Moreover, the action of $A$ by homography on $\mathbb{C}\text{P}^1$ preserves $\S$ and switches the two connected components of the complement. The matrix $A$ thus induces an orientation-reversing isometry, up to identifying the two components via $z\to\overline{z}$. We will thus denote $P_{[A]}$ by $P_\eta$. \\
The totally geodesic timelike plane $P_\eta$ can now be parametrized as follows. We have a map: 
\begin{equation}\label{refspa}
    \mathcal{I}\to\mathcal{I}_\eta
\end{equation}
from the spaces of reflections $\mathcal{I}$ along geodesic of $\H^2$, with values in $\PSL\simeq\A^{2,1}$. It's image it precisely $P_\eta.$ As seen in the proof of \ref{invertime} we have that an $X$ with determinant $-1$ is an inversion if and only if traceless. As $\det(A)=-1$ we have $\text{adj}(A)=-A^{-1}$, therefore $\langle XA,A\rangle=0$ if and only if $\text{tr}(X)=0$, that is $X$ is traceless hence an involution. This shows that the image of the map defined in Equation \refeq{refspa} is the entire plane $P_\eta$.\\  
In similar fashion to the spacelike case, using the transitivity of the group of isometries on timelike planes, every timelike planes is of the form above. We can show the following: 
\begin{lemma}
    Every timelike totally geodesic plane of $\A^{2,1}$ is of the form $P_\eta$ for some orientation-reversing isometry $\eta\in\PSL,$ and 
    \[
        \partial P_\eta=\text{graph}(\eta^{-1})\subset\T.
    \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We want to use Lemma \ref{convergenza} and the parametrization given in Equation \refeq{refspa}. Suppose we have a sequence $\mathcal{I}_n$ such that $\mathcal{I}_n\eta(z)\to x\in\partial\H^2$, for any $z\in\H^2$. Then, using that $\mathcal{I}_n$ is an involution and the continuity of the action of $\eta$ on $\overline{\H}^2$, $(\mathcal{I}_n\eta)^{-1}(z)=\eta^{-1}\mathcal{I}_n^{-1}(z)=\eta^{-1}\mathcal{I}_n(z)=\eta^{-1}(x).$ 
\end{proof}
\begin{observation}
    Since reflections of $\H^2$ are uniquely determined by (unoriented) geodesics, we can consider the map defined in \refeq{refspa} as a map from the space $\mathcal{G}(\H^2)$ of unoriented geodesics of $\H^2$ to $\PSL.$ This map is isometric with respect to the natural metric on $\mathcal{G}(\H^2)$ which makes it identified with the two-dimensional space $\A^{1,1}$ as treated more in detail by El Emam e Seppi in [\cite{emam2022gauss}, Example $6.1$] 
    \end{observation}
\section{Lightlike planes}
We are only left with case of lightlike totally geodesic planes. Those are the form $P_{[A]}$ for a nonzero matrix $A$ with $\det(A)=0$. Before giving an explicit description of such planes, we want to observe that their boundary will not be a graph in $\T$, unlike the case of spacelike and timelike planes. 

\begin{lemma}
    Every lightlike totally geodesic plane of $\A^{2,1}$ is of the form $P_{[A]}$ for some rank one matrix $A$, and: 
    \[
        \partial P_{[A]}=(\text{Im}(A)\times\S)\cup(\S\times\text{Ker}(A)).
    \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The point in $\partial P_{[A]}$ are projective class of rank one matrices satisfying $\langle X,A\rangle=0$, that is, such that $\text{tr}(X\text{adj}(A))=0.$ Given that $X\text{adj}(A)$ has vanishing determinant, by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem $X\text{adj}(A)$ is traceless if and only if it is nilpotent, that is, if and only if $X\text{adj}(A)X\text{adj}(A)=0.$ Now, given that image and kernel of both $X$ and $\text{adj}(A)$ have dimension 1, this happens if and only if: 
    \begin{equation}
        \text{Im}(X)=\text{Ker}(\text{adj}(A))\;\text{or}\;\text{Im}(\text{adj}(A))=\text{Ker}(A).
    \end{equation}
    Now, since $\det(A)=0$ implies $\text{adj}(A)A=A\text{adj}(A)=0$, the relations $\text{Ker}(\text{adj}(A))=\text{Im}(A)$ and $\text{Im}(\text{adj}(A))=\text{Ker}(A)$ hold. Hence $X\in P_{[A]}$ if and only if $\text{Im}(X)=\text{Im}(A)$ or $\text{Ker}(X)=\text{Ker}(A),$ which concludes because of the definition of the homeomorphism $\delta$.  
\end{proof}

Geometrically $\partial P_{[A]}$ is the union of two circles in $\T,$ one horizontal and one vertical, which intersect exactly at the point in $\T$ corresponding to $[A]\in \partial\A^{2,1}$ via $\delta$.\\
