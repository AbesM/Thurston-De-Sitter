\chapter{Anti-de Sitter space in dimension (2+1)}
We want now to specialize to dimension 3 Anti-de Sitter geometry. 
\section{The {PSL}$(2,\R)$ model.} The fundamental observation is the existance of a special model in dimension 3 which endows Anti-de Sitter space with a Lie group structure. To construct we observe that $q=-$det is a quadratic form with signature (2,2) over the real vector space $\mathcal{M}(2,\R)$, hence there is an identification between $(\mathcal{M}(2,\R),q)$ and $(\R^{2,2}, q_{2,2}),$ unique up to composition by elements in $O(2,2)$. Under this isomorphism $\H^{2,1}$ is identified with the Lie Group $SL(2,\R).$\\
Let us observe that $SL(2,\R)\times SL(2,\R$ acts linearly on $\mathcal{M}(2,\R)$ by left and right multiplication:
\[
    (A,B)\cdot X=AXB^{-1}.
\]
As a direct consequence of the Binet formula, the action preserves the quadratic form $q=-\det$ and thus induces a representation: 
\[ 
    \rho:SL(2,\R)\times SL(2,\R)\to O(\mathcal{M}(2,\R),q).    
\]

Since the center of $SL(2,\R)$ is $\{\pm \mathds{1}\},$ the Kernel of $\rho$ is $K=\{(\mathds{1},1),(-\1,-\1)\},$ and by a dimensional argument it turns out that the image of the representation is the connected component of the identity:

\[
    \text{Isom}_0(\H^{2,1})=\text{SO}(\mathcal{M}(2,\R),q)\simeq \frac{\text{SL}(2,\R)\times \text{SL}(2,\R)}{K}\
\]
