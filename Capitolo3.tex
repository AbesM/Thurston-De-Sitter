\chapter{Mess Work}

In his 1990 paper "Lorentz Spacetimes of Constant Curvature" \cite{Mess}, Geoffrey Mess offered a completely new approach to the study of spacetimes in 2+1-dimension by employing tools and techniques from low-dimensional geometry and topology. The aim of this chapter is to give a brief introduction to Mess ideas, with a special attention to AdS geometry. 

\section{Causality and Convexity properties}
We begin with some definitions:
\begin{definition}
    A subset $X$ of $\AS^{2,1}\cup \partial\AS^{2,1}$ is achronal (respectively acausal) if no pair of points in $X$ is connected by timelike (resp. causal) lines in $\AS^{2,1}$.
\end{definition}
Since acausality and achronality are conformally invariant notions, it will be often convenient to consider the metric $g_{\S^2}-dt^2$ on $\D\times\R$ introduced \todo{aggiustare.} which is confromal to the Poincar√© model. We give now a first useful carachterization of achronal and acausal sets:
\begin{lemma}
    A subset $X$ of $\AS^{2,1}\cup \partial\AS^{2,1}$ is achronal (respectively acausal) if and only if it is the graph of a function $f:D\to\R$ which is 1-Lipschitz, (resp. strictly 1-Lipschitz) with respect to the distance induced by the hemispherical metric $g_{\S^2}$.\\
    Where we have denoted $D=\pi_{\D}(X).$ 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    
\end{proof}

\textcolor{red}{mancano un po' di cose}

\begin{definition} Given a surface $S$ and a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g),$ a $\mathcal{C}^1$ immersion $\sigma:S\to M$ is \textit{spacelike} if the pull-back metric $\sigma^*g$ is Riemannian. If $\sigma$ is an embedding, we refer to its image as a \textit{spacelike surface}.
\end{definition}

A spacelike surface $S$ is locally acasual
